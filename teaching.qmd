### Biostatistics 699

[Biostatistics 699](https://sph.umich.edu/research-education/courses/course.php?courseID=BIOSTAT699) is my department's project-based capstone for MS students. I've co-taught this course with various colleagues since 2019.

### Public Health 345

I recently developed and taught [Public Health 345: Public Health Data Visualization](https://sph.umich.edu/research-education/courses/course.php?courseID=PUBHLTH345) for undergraduate students interested in public health. You can find my course slides [here](https://psboonstra.github.io/PH345_W2025/)
